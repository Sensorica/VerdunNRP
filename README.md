# VerdunNRP: Value Network Resource Planning

## Project Origin
This project is hard-forked from valnet/valueaccounting. The original authors are Bob Haugen and Lynn Foster.

## Verdun Project Version
This is the final Sensorica version of the NRP that will feature improved stability and UI for use in the Verdun Project. Renovations to this version are by David Hand (sqykly) with *a lot* of input from Bob and Lynn.

## Additional Installation Instructions

## Project Description
A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with [Sensorica](http://www.sensorica.co/), a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense. We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks. Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.
