valuenetwork
=====================
This project is hard-forked from valnet/valueaccounting.  The original authors are Bob Haugen and Foster Lynn.

This is final Sensorica version of the NRP that will feature improved stability and UI for use in the Verdun Project.  Renovations to this version are by David Hand (sqykly) with *a lot* of input from Bob and Lynn.

For additional installation instructions, refer to [the hacks readme](hacks/README.md).

Old readme.md follows:

A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with http://www.sensorica.co/ , a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.  Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.

Background on Value Networks: http://www.sensorica.co/value-networks

The prototype used the https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account starter project, built on the Django framework.

See /docs/install.txt for developer installation instructions or [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
