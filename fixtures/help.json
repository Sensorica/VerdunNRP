You can also add links to other documents if necessary. You can use this labnote for many work sessions. Best practice is to mark the date of every day you work on, before your notes for the day. \r\n\r\nRECORD YOUR TIME\r\nTo record the time you work on the project, you either press the START button when you start your work and the STOP button when you finish or before taking a brake, or simply enter the total amount of hours at the end of the day. NOTE that the time is cumulative over the entire day. That meas that if you do 3 hours of work in the morning, take a brake and close the page, and come back later the same day to do 2 more hours, you need to enter 5 at the end of the day. If you have entered 3, when you reopen the labnote the same day you'll see the number 3. If you change it to 2 after the brake, your total time for the day will be 2. So just keep adding hours to the total amount you do.      \r\n\r\nADD INPUTS\r\nClick the INPUT button to add inputs. Inputs are components you use, tool and equipment. Components have units of numbers, so you need to enter the number of components used. Their number is cumulative during the entire R&D process, unlike the time. This means that if another day you use another component that you used before, you need to go in there and increment that number by one. Tools and equipment have time units. That means that you need to enter the total amount of time you used a tool and equipment. The total time of use is also cumulative over the entire process. Next time you use the same equipment you need to increment the number of hours associated with that particular equipment. \r\n\r\nADD OUTPUTS"
