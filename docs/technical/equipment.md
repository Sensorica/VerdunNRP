# Equipment Module Documentation

## Overview

The Equipment module manages equipment resources, their usage, and associated financial transactions within the value network.

## Core Components

### 1. Equipment Usage Logging

The system tracks equipment usage through the following components:

#### Equipment Use Form
```python
class EquipmentUseForm:
    - event_date: Date of equipment use
    - from_agent: Paying agent
    - quantity: Equipment hours used
    - technician: Optional technician support
    - technician_hours: Technician time spent
```

#### Usage Scenarios
1. Commercial Use (scenario=1)
2. Project Use (scenario=2)
3. Fablab Use (scenario=3)
4. Techshop Use (scenario=4)
5. Other Use (scenario=5)

### 2. Payment Processing

The payment system handles:
- Equipment usage fees
- Technician fees
- Maintenance fees
- Consumable costs

#### Payment Flow
1. Usage logging
2. Fee calculation
3. Payment processing
4. Value distribution

### 3. Maintenance Tracking

Equipment maintenance is tracked through:
- Maintenance schedules
- Virtual accounts for maintenance funds
- Usage-based maintenance triggers
- Technician assignments

## Integration Points
