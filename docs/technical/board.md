# Board Module Documentation

## Overview

The Board module implements kanban-style workflow management for resource tracking and process management within the value network.

## Core Components

### 1. Board Structure

#### Columns
1. Available Resources
2. In Process
3. Completed
4. Archived

#### Resource States
- Available: Ready for use
- In Process: Currently being used
- Completed: Process finished
- Archived: Historical record

### 2. Resource Management

#### Resource Types
- Physical resources
- Digital resources
- Service resources
- Knowledge resources

#### Resource Operations
- Transfer
- Transform
- Consume
- Produce

### 3. Workflow Management

#### Process Types
1. Production Processes
   - Resource creation
   - Resource transformation
   - Quality control

2. Exchange Processes
   - Resource transfer
   - Value exchange
   - Documentation

3. Service Processes
   - Service delivery
   - Resource maintenance
   - Support services

## Implementation Details

### 1. Views and Controllers

#### Board Views
```python
def dhen_board(request, context_agent_id):
    # Main board view
    # Displays resources and processes

def transfer_resource(request, context_agent_id, resource_id):
    # Handle resource transfers between agents

def receive_directly(request, context_agent_id):
    # Direct resource reception
```

### 2. Models and Data Structure

#### Resource Tracking
- Current state
- Location
- Ownership
- Process stage
- Value attributes

#### Process Tracking
- Process type
- Participants
- Resources involved
- Timeline
- Outcomes

### 3. Forms and Input Handling

#### Resource Forms
- Creation forms
- Transfer forms
- State change forms
- Documentation forms

#### Process Forms
- Process initiation
- Stage progression
- Completion recording
- Documentation

## Integration Points

### 1. Value Network Integration
- Resource valuation
- Process value creation
- Exchange tracking
- Value distribution

### 2. Agent Integration
- Resource ownership
- Process participation
- Value claims
- Responsibilities

### 3. Equipment Integration
- Equipment resources
- Usage tracking
- Maintenance processes
- Resource allocation

## API Endpoints

### Board Management
```http
GET /board/{id}/
POST /board/{id}/update/
```

### Resource Management
```http
POST /board/resource/transfer/
POST /board/resource/receive/
GET /board/resource/{id}/
```

### Process Management
```http
POST /board/process/create/
PUT /board/process/{id}/update/
GET /board/process/{id}/
```

## Events and Workflows
