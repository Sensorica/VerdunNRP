# Process Patterns and Workflow

## Overview

Process patterns are fundamental building blocks in VerdunNRP that define how economic events, resources, and agents interact within value networks. They provide templates for common economic processes and workflows.

## Core Components

### ProcessPattern

The `ProcessPattern` model defines reusable templates for economic processes. Key features:

- Name and description for identification
- Associated event types and resource patterns
- Facet relationships for resource matching
- Use case associations

### Process Types

Process types are concrete implementations of process patterns:

- Inherit behavior from process patterns
- Define specific resource inputs/outputs
- Can be organized in hierarchical workflows
- Track estimated duration and context

### Resource Type Relationships

Process patterns define several types of resource relationships:

1. **Input Resources**
   - Consumed resources (used up in process)
   - Used resources (reusable after process)
   - Cited resources (referenced but not modified)

2. **Output Resources**
   - Produced resources
   - Modified resources
   - Transferred resources

3. **Work Resources**
   - Labor and skill contributions
   - Time-based inputs

## Workflow Implementation

### Process Sequences

- Processes can be linked into workflows using parent-child relationships
- Each process type can have previous and next process types
- Supports both linear and branching workflows

### Stage Management

- Resources track their current stage in the workflow
- Processes can modify resource states
- Supports reversion to previous stages

### Event Processing

1. **Event Types**
   - Creation events
   - Transformation events
   - Transfer events
   - Use events
   - Consumption events

2. **Event Validation**
   - Resource type matching
   - Quantity validation
   - Stage validation

## Use Cases

Process patterns support various economic use cases:

1. **Production**
   - Resource creation
   - Resource transformation
   - Work tracking

2. **Distribution**
   - Resource transfers
   - Shipments
   - Receipts

3. **Exchange**
   - Sales
   - Purchases
   - Reciprocal transfers

4. **Contribution**
   - Time contributions
   - Resource contributions
   - Expense contributions

## Integration Points

Process patterns integrate with other system components:

1. **Value Equations**
   - Track value creation
   - Calculate distributions
   - Compute income shares

2. **Economic Events**
   - Record actual process execution
   - Track resource flows
   - Maintain audit trail

3. **Agent Roles**
   - Define participant responsibilities
   - Track contributions
   - Manage access rights

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Selection**
   - Use existing patterns when possible
   - Create new patterns for unique processes
   - Document pattern purpose and constraints

2. **Workflow Design**
   - Keep processes atomic and focused
   - Use clear stage transitions
   - Maintain audit trail

3. **Resource Management**
   - Track resource states
   - Validate resource types
   - Monitor resource flows

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Production Process
```python
# Pattern definition
production_pattern = ProcessPattern.objects.create(
    name="Basic Production",
    description="Convert input resources into output products"
)

# Process type using pattern
production_process = ProcessType.objects.create(
    name="Widget Production",
    process_pattern=production_pattern,
    estimated_duration=180  # 3 hours
)
```

### Resource Transfer Process
```python
# Pattern definition
transfer_pattern = ProcessPattern.objects.create(
    name="Resource Transfer",
    description="Transfer resources between agents"
)

# Process type using pattern
transfer_process = ProcessType.objects.create(
    name="Inventory Transfer",
    process_pattern=transfer_pattern,
    estimated_duration=30  # 30 minutes
)
```
