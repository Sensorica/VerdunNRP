### Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - OAuth 2.0
   - JWT token management
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Granular permissions
   - Context-based restrictions
   - Audit logging

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest
   - TLS for data in transit
   - Regular security audits
   - Vulnerability scanning

4. **Compliance**
   - GDPR considerations
   - Data anonymization
   - Consent management
   - Audit trails
